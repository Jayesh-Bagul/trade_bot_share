<!-- In India people are not buying BTC using Rupee and hence this market is not much liquid. Since the market is not much liquid you will not get good price. So let us say from 1$ you are getting 0.1 BTC then from 83Rs you will get only 0.09 BTC. 
So what any smart person would do is first convert the Rs into dollars and then convert these dollars into BTC, rather then converting Rs into directly BTC.-->

<!-- 3 markets important for us :
1) BTC-USDT
2) BTC-INR
3) USDT-INR -->
<!-- RIght now since we are inside one market only (market means app here) txn fees is same. -->
